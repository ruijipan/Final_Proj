```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
```
In the origin data, each properties are compared with three comparable rentals.
So in total, information of four building(sets) forms one observation.


```{r}
comparable_rental_income_raw = read_csv("data/DOF__Cooperative_Comparable_Rental_Income__Citywide.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
head(comparable_rental_income_raw)

```

### Seperate the observations:

so I would like to separate one and 3 comparables with into four subset with same variable names for further processing.

delete `distance_from_co_op_in_miles*` to make the variables consistent to each other.

```{r}
namelist = comparable_rental_income_raw %>%
  select(-c("distance_from_co_op_in_miles","distance_from_co_op_in_miles_1","distance_from_co_op_in_miles_2")) %>%
  colnames()

## to be optimized 

rentalincom_ori = comparable_rental_income_raw %>%
  select(append(namelist[1:14],"report_year"))

std_colname = colnames(rentalincom_ori)

rentalincom_c1 = comparable_rental_income_raw %>%
  select(append(namelist[15:28],"report_year"))
colnames(rentalincom_c1) = std_colname

rentalincom_c2 = comparable_rental_income_raw %>%
  select(append(namelist[29:42],"report_year"))
colnames(rentalincom_c2) = std_colname
  
rentalincom_c3 = comparable_rental_income_raw %>%
  select(append(namelist[43:56],"report_year"))
colnames(rentalincom_c3) = std_colname

transformed_rental_income = rbind(rentalincom_ori,rentalincom_c1,rentalincom_c2,rentalincom_c3)
```

### clean data 

```{r}
transformed_rental_income = transformed_rental_income %>% 
  na.omit() 

save(transformed_rental_income, file = "data/cleaned_data.RData")
```


### Data description

Boro-Block-Lot: Borough-Block-Lot(BBL) location

```{r}
comparable_rental_income_raw %>% distinct(building_classification)
comparable_rental_income_raw %>% distinct(neighborhood)
comparable_rental_income_raw %>% distinct(year_built)
```

Gross SqFt: Gross square footage of the building
Estimated Gross Income: Estimated Income per SquareFoot * Gross SquareFoot
Gross Income per SqFt: Estimated income per squarefoot of median comparable
Estimated Expense: Estimated Expense per SquareFoot * Gross SquareFoot
Expense per SqFt: Estimated expense per squarefoot of median comparab
Net Operating Income: Estimated Gross Income-Estimated Expense
Full Market Value: Current year’s total market value of the land and building
Market Value per SqFt: Full Market Value/ Gross SquareFoot
Distance from Co-op in miles: calculated distance from comparable to the subject

## plots
#built year vs value
